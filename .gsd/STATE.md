### Current Position
- **Phase**: Phase 22: Responsive Hero Height
- **Task**: Implement clamped hero metrics
- **Status**: DONE

### What was just accomplished
- **Responsive Hook**: Updated `useResponsive` to calculate `heroHeight` and `heroAspectRatio` dynamically.
- **Clamping Logic**: Implemented vertical constraints (max 55% screen height on tablets) to prevent hero sections from pushing content off-screen.
- **UI Integration**: Refactored `HeroSlide` and `HeroCarousel` (skeleton) to consume dynamic height metrics and constrained content width for readability on ultra-wide screens.

### Next Steps
- Implementation of Trakt Ratings modal and Catalog card interaction (Phase 5-7).
- Auth UI Redesign (Phase 17).
