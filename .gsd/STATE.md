**Status**: Active (resumed 2026-01-18T19:57:16+01:00)
**Recent Accomplishments**: 
  - **Native Foundation Complete**: Implemented `crispy-native-core` Expo module with `jlibtorrent` and `NanoHTTPD` for streaming.
  - **Addon Engine Complete**: Integrated Stremio V3 protocol support with direct-fetch optimization for React Native.
  - **Provider Layer Complete**: Added result aggregation, ID-based deduplication, and metadata enrichment.
  - **Architecture Simplified**: Removed redundant CORS proxy logic from both native and JS layers for a leaner "Native-First" approach.
**Next Steps**: Plan Phase 3 (Catalog Explorer UI) and connect the Provider layer to the home screens.
